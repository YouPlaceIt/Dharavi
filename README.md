 
Welcome to YouPlaceIt! a serious game about urban development and community interaction.  The game aims to show the role of negotiation between different social categories when trying to achieve better urban development. 

This implementation is entered on Dharavi, an area of Mumbai that is considered in need of urban development with an emphasis on road construction.

You can already see a map of Dharavi and the properties that have already been tagged by other players.

You can chose to login or play as an Unidentified person, that has no determined role within the community but is still able to participate in the discussions that take place in the chatroom or vote.

If you chose to have an identity in the game, you should choose to login (or register in case you do not have an account yet).

After logging in, you will be assigned a role within the game (at this moment the role is only informative) - as a private person, a government representative, the representative of an NGO, the representative of a company/local industry or a developer.  Each of these roles has their own desires and roles within the game.

The next step is to tag your properties. You can do that that by pressing the Tag Properties button and selecting your property on the map. Before actually tagging it you have to chose if it a circle or a rectangle, a name for it and the price you want to charge for one square meter of your property.
If you make any mistake while tagging, donâ€™t worry, you can always fix it during the next step.

Press Add Properties to view your newly selected properties and decide if you want to permanently add them to the database or delete them. After each operation Press Add Properties again to refresh the list.

After you finish adding your properties, you can press Road Construction to move on to the next phase of the game.

Once you are in the road construction phase, you can chose to join the ChatRoom by pressingOpenChat and discuss your decisions with other players, either in the main room or in private chats.

By pressing Show roads, you can see all the roads that have already been proposed by others.

If you wish to draw a new road,  press Plan Road, then draw your desired road on the map.

If you are not satisfied with the road you have designed, you can erase the drawing by pressing Reset.

You can determine which properties are affected by the road you have drawn or selected by pressing Process Road. This is a necessary step you you want to populate the negotiation list later on, or if you wish to calculate the price you have to pay to be able to build the road.

You can add the road you have designed to the database so that other players can also see it by pressing Propose Road.

If you want to delete or select one of the already proposed roads, press Vote Road. The road you have selected from the drop down list will become black on the map.
When a road is selected, you can vote for it or delete it permanently. The selected road becomes the current road - it can be processed and then negotiations can start.
To refresh the list, press Vote Road again.

Choose Negotiate if you want to start the automatic negotiation with the owners of the properties the proposed road is intersecting.
The negotiations are done individually for each of the properties.

Press Construction Cost to view the cost of the proposed road before the negotiations take place.

Press Increase Budget to introduce your budget or increase it (you start the game with a budget of 0).
